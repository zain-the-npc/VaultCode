#  VaultCode Web – Streamlit Version

This is the Streamlit-based version of the VaultCode encryption tool.(Made on Day-15)

### Features:
- Text encryption/decryption using a password
- Streamlit UI with copy-to-clipboard support
- Deployable globally on Streamlit Cloud

### ✨ Yeah, the copy to clipboard thing is broken — and guess what? I’m not gonna fix it (at least not today). Priorities, right? ✨
